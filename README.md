<b>Marketing Analytics</b><br>
<b>Introduction</b><br>
The survey study in question was designed to explore the connection between certain types of consumers to the sports and energy drink market. Their preference in brand, or lack
thereof, would be in part due to their demographics, behavior in activities related to exercise, as well as use history in the market. The survey was conducted in the Spring of 2020 and generated 210 responses that span the connected United States.

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
The surveyors constructed an excellent questionnaire that allowed the team to understand the
types of people that are active in the market. The analysis describes the reasons why a person
exercises or what a customer looks out for while buying a sports drink. With the help of
Multivariate Analysis techniques like Principal Component Analysis followed by K-means
clustering we could interpret answers and group people who think alike. With the help of the
groups and the interpretations we can plan Marketing Strategies and target a focused group of
people according to the characteristics of our product.
